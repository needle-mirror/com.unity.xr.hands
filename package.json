Runtime is invalidated when the `XrInstance` is destroyed.\n- Fixed threshold-checking on gesture conditions to allow for the full range in `XRFingerShapeCondition`.\n- `XRCommonHandGestures` data retrieval no longer GC.Allocs.\n- Updated app space change behavior for XR provider to no longer destroy hand trackers only to recreate them the next update.\n- Fixed issue where XrHands would try to update hand joints with an uninitialized XrTime value of XR_INFINITE_DURATION."
