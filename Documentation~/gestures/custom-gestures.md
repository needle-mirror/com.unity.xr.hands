# Custom gestures

The XR Hands package provides a custom gesture recognizer that can detect when the user performs a gesture that you define as a hand shape and orientation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The recognizer can detect static poses only. Gestures involving motion, such as a swipe or a throw, are not supported.

To add a custom gesture to a scene, you create and configure a [Static Hand Gesture](xref:xrhands-static-gesture-component) component. This component references a [Hand Shape](xref:xrhands-hand-shapes) or [Hand Pose](xref:xrhands-hand-poses) asset and an [XR Hand Tracking Events](xref:UnityEngine.XR.Hands.XRHandTrackingEvents) object. It dispatches [UnityEvents](xref:UnityEngine.Events.UnityEvent) when it detects that the user's hand matches the configured hand shape and orientation and when a gesture is no longer detected.
