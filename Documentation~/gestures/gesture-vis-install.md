2. Select the **XR Hands** package from the list of packages in the project.
3. Click **Samples** to open the sample import section of the window.
4. Click **Import** next to the **Gestures** sample.

The sample files are copied into your project under **Assets/Samples/XR Hands/{version}/Gestures**.

## Run the gesture debugger

To run the debugger scene, build the project and deploy it on a device that supports hand tracking. Refer to [Customize the gesture debugger scene](xref:xrhands-customize-gesture-visualizer) for instructions on how to add your own hand shapes and gestures to the visualizer.
