# Gesture debugger

The **Gestures** sample provides a gesture debugging scene that you can use to help design and test gestures.

The debug visualizer in this scene shows:

* The current [finger shape](xref:xrhands-finger-shapes) values for all fingers.
* The target finger shape values for one configured [HandShape](xref:xrhands-hand-shapes) asset.
* The tolerance range for the configured hand shape asset.
* Gesture detection of six preconfigured gestures.

> [!TIP]
> You can edit the HandGesture scene to change the hand shape used for the target values and tolerances shown on the finger shape graphs. You can also replace the preconfigured gestures with your own or add additional gestures.
